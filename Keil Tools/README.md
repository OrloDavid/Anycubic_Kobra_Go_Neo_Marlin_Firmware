# Project Scripts and Utilities

This repository contains a set of tools designed to facilitate the management of project directories and groups within the Keil uVision IDE.

## Contents

- **PowerShell Scripts:**
  - `Get-GCC-Dirs.ps1`: This script is used to generate a list of directory paths from your project, which can then be directly used in the Keil uVision IDE for setting up include paths in your project settings.
  - `Get-Group-Dirs.ps1`: This script generates a simplified list of directory names intended for use as group names within the Keil uVision IDE, enhancing the readability and manageability of your project structure.

- **AutoIT Script:**
  - `KeiluV_Input_Groups.au3`: An automation script that inputs the group names generated by `Get-Group-Dirs.ps1` into the Keil uVision IDE, creating a more organized project structure.

- **Output Example:**
  - `group-dirs.txt`: An example output from `Get-Group-Dirs.ps1`, showcasing the format of the generated group names.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setting Up Include Paths:**
   - Start with running `Get-GCC-Dirs.ps1` to obtain the necessary directory paths for your project's include settings.
   - The script will output a text file containing the directory paths formatted for direct use in Keil uVision's 'Project Options > C/C++ Tab > Include Paths' input field.
   - Clear the existing paths in the 'Include Paths' input box, paste the contents from the script's output, and save your changes.

2. **Generating Group Names:**
   - Execute `Get-Group-Dirs.ps1` on your project's directories to produce a list of group names, which will be saved to a text file (e.g., `group-dirs.txt`).
   - You may customize the list by removing any unwanted group names, tailoring the project structure to your preferences.

3. **Automating Group Creation:**
   - Run the `KeiluV_Input_Groups.au3` AutoIT script to automatically input the group names into Keil uVision.
   - Ensure no other instances of Keil uVision are running, and refrain from using your PC during the script's operation to avoid any interference.
   - The script will perform checks and provide notifications throughout the process. Press the `Esc` key to terminate the script at any time.

Please make sure to follow these steps in the given order for the optimal setup of your project environment.
